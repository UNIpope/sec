1.The following information was encrypted using Caesar Cipher. Decrypt it.

one  variation  to  the  standard  caesar  cipher  is  when the    alphabet
is    keyed    by    using    a    word.    in    the traditional  variety,
one  could  write  the  alphabet  on two  strips  and  just  match  up  the
strips  after  sliding the  bottom  strip  tothe  left  or  right.  to  encode,
you would  find  a  letter  in  the  top  row  and  substitute  it for  the
letter  in  the  bottom  row.  for  a  keyed  version, one would not use a
standard alphabet, but would first write  a  word  (omitting  duplicated  letters)
and  then write the  remaining  letters  of  the  alphabet.  for  the example below,
i used a key of rumkin.com and you will see that the period is removed because
it is not a letter. you   will   also   notice   the   second   m   is   not
included because   there   was   an   m   already   and   you   can't   have duplicates.

3.The following message has been encrypted using Vinegeré Cipher with a keyword KISWAHILI. Decrypt the message.

NIST  IS  ABOUT  TO  ANNOUNCE  THE  NEW  HASH  ALGORITHM  THAT  WILL BECOME SHA-3.
THIS IS THE RESULT OF A SIX-YEAR COMPETITION, AND MY  OWN  SKEIN  IS  ONE  OF  THE
FIVE  REMAINING  FINALISTS  (OUT  OF AN INITIAL 64). IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE FOR ME
TO AFFECT THE FINAL DECISION, BUT I AM HOPING FOR "NO AWARD." IT'S NOT THAT THE NEWHASH
FUNCTIONS AREN'T ANY GOOD, IT'S THAT WE DON'T REALLY NEED ONE. WHEN WE STARTED
THIS PROCESS BACK IN 2006, IT LOOKED AS IF WE   WOULD   BE   NEEDING   A   NEW
HASH   FUNCTION   SOON.   THE   SHA FAMILY  (WHICH  IS  REALLY  PART  OF  THE
MD4  AND  MD5  FAMILY),  WAS UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE FROM NEW TYPES OF CRYPTANALYSIS.
WE   DIDN'T   KNOW   HOW   LONG   THE   VARIOUS   SHA-2 VARIANTS  WOULD  REMAIN
SECURE.  BUT  IT'S  2012,  AND  SHA-512  IS  STILL LOOKING GOOD.EVEN  WORSE,
NONE  OF  THE  SHA-3  CANDIDATES  IS  SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER.  SOME  ARE  FASTER,
BUT NOT  ORDERS  OF  MAGNITUDE  FASTER. SOME  ARE  SMALLER  IN  HARDWARE,
BUT  NOT  ORDERS  OF  MAGNITUDE SMALLER.  WHEN  SHA-3  IS  ANNOUNCED,  I'M  GOING
TO  RECOMMEND THAT,    UNLESS    THE    IMPROVEMENTS    ARE    CRITICAL    TO
THEIR APPLICATION, PEOPLE STICK WITH THE TRIED AND TRUE SHA-512.ATLEAST  FOR  A
WHILE.  I  DON'T  THINK  NIST  IS  GOING  TO  ANNOUNCE "NO  AWARD";  I  THINK
IT'S  GOING  TO  PICK  ONE.  AND  OF  THE  FIVE REMAINING,  I  DON'T  REALLY  HAVE
A  FAVORITE.  OF  COURSE  I  WANT SKEIN  TO  WIN,  BUT  THAT'S  OUT  OF  PERSONAL
PRIDE,  NOT  FOR  SOME OBJECTIVE  REASON.  AND  WHILE  I  LIKE  SOME  MORE  THAN
OTHERS,  I THINK  ANY  WOULD  BE  OKAY.  WELL,  MAYBE  THERE'S  ONE  REASON  NIST
SHOULD  CHOOSE  SKEIN.  SKEIN  ISN'T  JUST  A  HASH  FUNCTION,  IT'S THE
LARGE-BLOCK  CIPHER  THREEFISH  AND  A  MECHANISM  TO  TURN  IT INTO  A  HASH
FUNCTION.  I  THINK  THE  WORLD  ACTUALLY  NEEDS  A LARGE-BLOCK CIPHER,
AND IF NIST CHOOSES SKEIN, WE'LL GET ONE
